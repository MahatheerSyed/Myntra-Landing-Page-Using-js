# Myntra-Landing-Page-Using-js
**Myntra Landing Page**
This project demonstrates how I used JavaScript to create a dynamic Myntra landing page. Instead of writing repetitive HTML code for each product card, I stored the data for each card as objects. I created a function that generates the card elements based on the provided data and then uses a display function to render them on the page.

Key Features:
**Dynamic Card Creation:** By passing data objects to a function, cards are generated dynamically rather than hardcoding each card's HTML.
Efficient Data Handling: The product details (such as title, image, price, etc.) are stored in JavaScript objects, making it easy to update and manage the information.
**Clean and Modular Code:** The code is more maintainable, as the structure for creating and displaying cards is abstracted into functions.
